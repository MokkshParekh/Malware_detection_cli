## Introduction

**Project 164** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for scanning files and directories for malware using **YARA rules**. The tool can analyze individual files or recursively scan directories, reporting any detected malware signatures based on the YARA rules provided in the `rules` directory.

This project is designed to work on both **Linux** and **Windows**, providing a lightweight, cross-platform malware detection solution. 

## Features

- Scans files and directories for malware using YARA rules.
- Silent unless malware is detected, making it ideal for automated scanning.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux & Windows).
